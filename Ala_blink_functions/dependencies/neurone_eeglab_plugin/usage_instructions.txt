Using the plugin
----------------

For installation instructions, please refer to the file installation_instructions.txt.


After installation, the plugin can be found in EEGLAB's menus as follows:


EEGLAB versions up to 11_0_1_1b:
     File -> Import data -> From a Mega NeurOne device

EEGLAB version 11_0_2_1b and newer:
     File -> Import data -> Using EEGLAB functions and plugins -> From a Mega NeurOne device


When selecting this plugin, a GUI will present itself.

   (1) Choose the main directory of the NeurOne -recording (typically named e.g.. '2012-06-25T103750').
       This directory contains e.g. the file  'Protocol.xml' (among other files).

   (2) After the directory has been chosen, a new GUI is presented, allowing you to choose which channels to read.
       In order to select individual channels, uncheck the checkbox 'Read all channels', after which you can select
       individual channels. Hold down the [ctrl]-key to select multiple channels.
